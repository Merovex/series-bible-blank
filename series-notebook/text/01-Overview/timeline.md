When you have a clear articulation of setting and contexts of your storyworld you give your self the best chance of devising an episodic series that is sustainable and dramatically dynamic. A timeline allows you to see the patterns of those events which fuel the drama.

Constructing a timeline asks “How did the world get to be the way that it is?”

Timeline events can be divided into different types:

INFLUENCING EVENTS
Things that happen that alter behaviour from that point or which shape, redefine or alter a character, entity or institution.

DECISIONS
Specific choices taken by a character, society, organisation or entity which represent a fork in the road. Points on the timeline where a decision was made that altered the trajectory of the 'storyworld'.

MILESTONES
Moments or events in the timeline where a threshold is passed and from which there is no turning back for a character, institution or society. A timeline Milestone is a saturation point, a moment of critical mass and transformation.
