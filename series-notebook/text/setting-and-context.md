SETTING details the time, place and period of your series - the Where and When. The length of this document can vary depending on the genre of the series. A SciFi drama for example may need detailed description of the setting where as a suburban drama in the present day may be relatively short.

But Setting should be more than just a Place. Geographic, environmental, stylistic and structural all shape the SETTING.
___

The CONTEXT outlines the world of your series going beyond the Where and When to encompass the Why - the circumstances, rules and given principles of the world your story plays out in. Consider:

- Social groupings and hierarchies
- Character and World Relationships
- Established Behaviours and Attitudes
- Rules that govern the Tone of the story (certain types of humour, language, inflections.)
- Institutions, legal frameworks, belief systems
